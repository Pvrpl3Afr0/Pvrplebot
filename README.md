# Pvrplebot
A (WIP) Python script with a bunch of tools used to assist with random things.

Pvrplebot (Pronounced "Purple Bot) is a jumble of conditional programming tossed together into one platform that will ideally be comprehensive and easy to use.

Some of the desired features that Pvrple will have are mostly things I've written myself in the past including;
1. A password generator using the random library and a list of characters.
2. Temperature converters maybe?
3. Minigames like rolling a die and/or flipping a coin.
I also want a main "Info" page with descriptions of what things do and how they do it, and why I wanted to work on Pvrplebot.
